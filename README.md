# Social App

Our-Time

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application, which would also use a server backend but i have hardcoded inputs
for this repo.

This First Screen is your profile and by holding down on any tile you can change it. you can also see other peoples profiles if i added a friends system but i do have a example one if you click on the orange button.
